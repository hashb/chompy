<H1>What you should know about active content</H1>

<P>Active content (for example, things like stock tickers, video, or animation) can enhance your browsing experience. It relies on either ActiveX controls or computer code (called a <I>script</I>) to work properly.</P>

<P>ActiveX controls can sometimes malfunction or display content that you don’t want. They can also be used to collect information from your computer without your permission, damage information on your computer, install software without your consent, or allow someone else to control your computer remotely. Given these risks, you should only install these programs if you completely trust the publisher.</P>

<P>When you encounter a webpage (or insert a CD) that is trying to run active content on your computer, you should receive a message prompting you to decide whether you want to allow the content to run. If you are certain that you want to allow the active content, click <B>Yes</B> in the message box. By clicking <B>Yes</B>, you allow the active content to run on the webpage or CD you’re viewing on that occasion. If you leave the page and return to it later, you will receive the message again. You can avoid being prompted every time by allowing any website to run scripts and ActiveX controls, however you should be extremely careful about doing this, as it might put your computer at risk for malicious software.</P>
